#' @section Persistence data:
#'
#'   *Persistence data* encode the values of an underlying parameter
#'   \eqn{\epsilon} at which topological features appear ("birth") and disappear
#'   ("death"). The difference between the birth and the death of a feature is
#'   called its *persistence*. Whereas topological features may be of different
#'   dimensions, persistence data sets usually also include the dimension of
#'   each feature.
#'
#'   **ggtda** expects persistence data to have at least three columns: birth,
#'   death, and dimension.
